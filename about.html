                            <h3>Creating Safety and Hope</h3>
                            <p>
                                The origins of Life Skills Oasis begin with the return of its founder, Newton, to his birthplace after completing high school. Although his parents lived there, Newton quickly recognized the severe social challenges facing the local youth. The group he joined was characterized by reckless living, a lack of effective methods for approaching daily life, and a general disrespect for adults and one another.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- Responding to Crisis -->
                        <div class="about-section">
                            <!-- <img src="img/responding.jpg" alt="Responding to Crisis"> -->
                            <div>
                                <h3>Responding to Crisis</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The environment Newton found himself in was marked by dysfunction and despair. The community grappled with rampant violence, where fatal conflicts occurred frequently among young people. There were also severe public health crises stemming from extremely inadequate sanitation practices. Furthermore, widespread alcohol and drug abuse affected both the youth and their parents, contributing to an overall atmosphere of reckless and inappropriate behavior.
                                    Newton, having been fortunate enough to attend school through sponsorship despite his past as a street boy, recognized that he was living among a group that knew "very little about decent living". After struggling to survive in this environment for a year or two, he felt strongly that "something needs to be done" to create a better future. At 19 years old, he resolved to nurture a "new generation" that would avoid the destructive lifestyle he witnessed.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>The Birth of the Oasis</h3>
                            <p>
                                Newton’s initiative began simply. One day, he woke up, made a ball from paper bags, and started dribbling it near some houses. A few children, around six or seven years old, joined him. This activity became an everyday evening routine.
                                Crucially, this allowed Newton to avoid sitting with the older boys in the slum, where drugs and alcohol were prevalent. By acting "childish" and hiding "in the children," he insulated himself from the dangers and the "rubbish" activities of the older youth.
                                As the group grew, Newton began integrating essential life teachings during playtime. During halftime, he would sit with the children and share stories, acting like a grandfather. He taught them fundamental concepts such as the dangers of drugs and substance abuse. He also introduced basic lessons on hygiene and proper sanitation, emphasizing the need for safe alternatives to the highly dangerous methods being used in the community. In this way, he began creating a new, healthier generation.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Formalizing the Vision</h3>
                            <p>As their numbers increased, Newton used money from his other work to buy a "good ball", and the group formalized into a team. They named themselves Life Skills Oasis. The name "Oasis" was chosen deliberately because, much like water in the desert, this group was the "only place" in the slum where one could find "life skills," "safety," and "good manners behavior" amidst the chaos.
                                Life Skills Oasis was not merely a football club; teaching life skills was its core purpose. When the team began playing against other groups, Newton would request time during halftime to teach life skills to both his 20 boys and the opposing team. This educational approach was so effective that, after approximately seven or eight years, the coaches of the opposing teams adopted the practice themselves, integrating life skills into their post-game routines.
                                This dedicated work resulted in a "changed community". Severe antisocial behaviors, such as the use of highly unsafe sanitation practices, widespread violence, and public sexual activity, are now "rarely found," as the current generation has grown to understand that such behaviors are "rubbish" and have "no advantage".

                        <div>
                            <h3>Expansion and Philosophy</h3>
                            <p>Several years later, in 2015, Life Skills Oasis expanded its efforts to reach the most vulnerable—the "real street children" in Thika town. Newton, along with other local volunteers, founded the Thika Street Family Football Club. The goal was to teach life skills, encourage them to overcome drug use, and guide them "back to school". This project successfully moved 37 street children within one year from the streets into school, where they remain enrolled today.
                            The organization focuses on reaching those who are lost in life skills, whether they are struggling with substance misuse, sexual misuse, or severe poverty. Life Skills Oasis operates on the belief that many people are simply lacking knowledge or are "not using what they have effectively".
                            The organization’s motto is: "Use what you have effectively".
                            The physical infrastructure of Life Skills Oasis was built over time, supported by the reputation and dedication of the organization. International volunteers visiting the site often noticed critical needs—such as the lack of proper toilets or the children eating on a dusty floor—and addressed those needs directly. Slowly, volunteer by volunteer, the facilities (including the hall, a proper toilet, and a concrete floor) were put in place.

                            Raphael Muturi, known as Passie (31), is a core volunteer at Life Skills Oasis. Passie faced early challenges, leaving school around age 12 and living on the streets due to peer pressure and lack of food.
                            A turning point came when founder Newton invited him to volunteer (around 2014). Life Skills Oasis helped Passie abstain from substance misuse, enabling him to focus on himself and his desire to "give back to the community".
                            In 2015, Passie was key in expanding the mission to Thika town, helping found the Thika Street Family Football Club.

                            Haston Gichaga (23), joined Life Skills Oasis at age three. His parents sought to ensure he was taught "how to be in a good manner" and avoid the slum's crime and drug abuse.
                            Haston later studied Graphic Design and Computer at Jordan College, with fees paid by a Canadian sponsor met through Oasis. Now running his own cyber cafe business for three years, he also volunteers (since 2022), offering younger children encouragement. Haston credits the organization for his growth, noting his favorite part is that "you keep learning" through workshops and programs.
