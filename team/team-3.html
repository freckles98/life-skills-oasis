                    Raphael Pi Muri, known as Passie, is a foundational volunteer, dedicated mentor, and essential operational member of Life Skills Oasis, where he has committed approximately 17 years of service since joining the organization around 2014 or 2015. Passie's involvement began after meeting founder Newton, who was his teacher at a previous organization. Facing challenging circumstances in his youth, including peer pressure and occasionally a lack of food at home, Passie had dropped out of high school at Form Two around age 12. Newton encouraged him to volunteer at Oasis to give back to the community and avoid sitting idle. Passie joined because he wanted to give back to the community, change it, and interact with the children.
