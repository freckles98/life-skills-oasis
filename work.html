                                The Life Skills Oasis Rescue Centre is dedicated to identifying vulnerable children and providing intensive non-formal education to support their confident and successful return to school. Our program emphasizes in-depth rehabilitation and family reintegration, strengthening family bonds and creating a supportive home environment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Every day from <strong>8:00 AM to 2:00 PM</strong>, children benefit from a safe, nurturing, and structured environment that promotes their growth into healthy, stable, and happy individuals. The day begins with outdoor activities such as <strong>soccer and games</strong>, followed by indoor learning sessions or quiet TV time. Children are provided with a nutritious meal during the day, which for many is <strong>the only meal they receive</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During the school term, most school-age children attend classes, while younger children join the daily program. This time is also used to identify children living on the streets, with the goal of <strong>reuniting them with their families</strong> and supporting their return to school.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our team of experienced volunteers works closely with each child and their family, tailoring support to address the complex challenges that may have led the child to the streets.

                            The Life Skills Oasis Sports Project is a child-friendly initiative committed to engaging children through fun and structured activities using a child-centered approach. Football, a favorite among most children—especially those from the streets—is used as a tool to attract and retain participants in the program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have established boys’ and girls’ football clubs where children enjoy regular training sessions and matches. Children are provided with footballs, jerseys, boots, and trophies to encourage participation. Teams are organized by age groups (U13, U15, U17) and sometimes compete with clubs from other villages, such as Sheds Football Club, Angaza Football Club, and Thika Sporting, as well as in Nairobi-based tournaments like the FKF Tournament. These sporting activities promote discipline, teamwork, confidence, and healthy lifestyles while supporting rehabilitation.

                        <p>
                            Many street children and children from poor families in our community often have only one meal a day, typically in the evening. To support their growth, focus, and energy levels, Life Skills Oasis provides a cup of nutritious porridge at 10 a.m., serving as breakfast before other activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At 1 p.m., children are served a balanced meal, usually consisting of local vegetables, rice, maize and beans, or maize meal. When available, children also receive a piece of fruit to provide essential vitamins, boost immunity, and reduce common illnesses. The feeding program relies largely on sponsorship, ensuring that vulnerable children have access to regular and healthy meals.

                        <h3>Education Empowerment</h3>

                        <p>
                            In Kenya, many youth from disadvantaged backgrounds face barriers in competing academically and professionally due to limited access to education and skills training. Life Skills Oasis seeks to bridge this gap by empowering children and young people with basic education, vocational skills, and practical training that enhance their employability and ability to succeed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Older street and vulnerable children who cannot reintegrate into formal schools are guided into work skills training and supported to pursue entrepreneurship in areas such as barbering, salons, welding, and motorcycle mechanics. By connecting teenagers with apprenticeships and mentors, the program provides practical experience and pathways to self-sufficiency, helping youth improve their future prospects despite economic challenges.

                        <p>
                            At Life Skills Oasis, we address the root causes of challenges affecting children by engaging directly with their families. Many families face poverty, chronic illness, HIV, addiction, or other hardships. Our Parent Support Groups bring caregivers together to receive counseling, training in positive parenting, and guidance on income-generating activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through group support, table banking, and skill-building workshops, parents gain practical tools to improve their household well-being and provide for their children. This holistic approach ensures that after rehabilitation, children return to a stable, nurturing family environment, strengthening both familial and community bonds.

                                In addition to our core programs, Life Skills Oasis runs several community initiatives to support vulnerable children and families. Our annual <strong>Christmas Party</strong> invites blind community members, children, and their parents to the organization, providing food, flour, oil, and vegetables. During the celebration, participants enjoy games, singing, and storytelling, fostering joy and connection.
                            </p>

                                In 2022, we launched a <strong>Water Project</strong> to address community water shortages. Government water supplies were only available three days a week, so we dug a borehole and successfully accessed groundwater. This water is pumped and distributed to the most vulnerable families, while slightly able households contribute 5 shillings per jerry can, ensuring sustainable access for all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our <strong>Barber Shop Initiative</strong>, started in late 2023, provides vulnerable children with affordable haircuts in a space above the school. Haircuts normally cost 50 shillings, which is expensive for many families. While we operate almost every weekend, challenges such as equipment breakdowns occasionally occur, but the initiative continues to be a valuable service for the community.
